- **Context-Aware Optimization**: Different blur placeholders for hero, product, card, and thumbnail contexts
- **Aggressive Preloading**: Starts loading images 200px before they're visible
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors and reports image loading performance

### 2. **Image Optimization Enhancements**
- **Ultra-Fast Thumbnails**: 35% quality, WebP format, ~50KB size for instant loading
- **Enhanced Blur Placeholders**: Context-aware SVG placeholders with realistic gradients
- **Critical Image Preloading**: Preloads first 4-6 images on page load for instant visual feedback
- **Smart Caching**: Aggressive browser caching with memory leak prevention

### 3. **Updated Components**
- ✅ **FastImage.jsx**: Complete rewrite with instant blur-to-sharp loading
- ✅ **Category.jsx**: Replaced manual image loading with FastImage
- ✅ **ViewAllProducts.jsx**: Integrated FastImage with performance tracking
